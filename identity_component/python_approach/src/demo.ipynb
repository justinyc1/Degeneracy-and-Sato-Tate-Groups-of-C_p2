    "This is the overall logic of our Python scripts. We began our research by generating the tuples via brute force. However, after noticing that all indecomposable tuples for $m = p^2$ and $d = \\frac{p+1}{2}$ are generated using Shioda's equation, we wrote a new script that was much more efficient for generating the tuples. We also modified these tuples to help generate the max element information for each tuple which we used to compute moment statistics."
